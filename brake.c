//////////////BRAKE///////////////
/*The break and continue statements let you control loops for those special occasions when you want to quit a loop early or repeat a loop sooner than it would normally repeat.

Typically, break appears in the body of an if statement.

Here is the format of
break:

loopâ€™s body, break terminates that loop immediately, and the rest of the program continues.*/

used in the printf() control string. C interprets a percent sign as a control code
unless you put two of them together, as done in this program. Then it still interprets the
first percent sign as a control code for the second. In other words, the percent sign is a
control code for itself.*/
