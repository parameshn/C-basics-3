/*///////WHILE LOOP/////////////////////////////

while (condition)
{ block of one or more C statements; }

The condition is a relational test that is exactly like the relational test condition you learned
for if. The block of one or more C statements is called the body of the while.
The body of the while repeats as long as the condition is true. This is the difference between a
while statement and an if statement: The body of the if executes if the condition is true. The
body of the if executes only once, however, whereas the body of the while can execute a lot of
times

///Never put a semicolon after the whileâ€™s parenthesis. The semicolon follows only the statements inside the
body of the while.
